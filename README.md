# web3-token-economics-notes
Learning notes and reflections during Web3 Internship Bootcamp.

## Background
I come from a finance & investment analysis background. My interest in Web3 focuses on token incentives, governance mechanisms, and how protocol design affects long-term value creation.

## Learning Focus
- Ethereum ecosystem basics (accounts, transactions, smart contracts)
- Token economics & incentive design
- DAO governance and real-world case studies

## Current Status
This repository is used to track my learning notes and reflections during the Web3 Internship Bootcamp (Winter 2026).

## Output Plan
- Short notes on token models and protocols
- Case-based analysis from a finance perspective
- Weekly learning summaries

## Scope & Non-goals
This repository focuses on understanding Web3 from a finance and mechanism perspective. It is not intended to showcase advanced
engineering skills at this stage.

## Why I joined this program
I want to understand Web3 not as a short-term narrative, but as a system of incentives and coordination.

## My expectation
Through real tasks and collaboration, I hope to test whether I can contribute to Web3 from a finance and mechanism perspective.

## Note
This is a living document and will evolve as my understanding deepens throughout the program.
